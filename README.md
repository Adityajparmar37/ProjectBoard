## üìë Synopsis 

- A platform for seamless project management and team collaboration, enabling task assignment, file sharing, and real-time chat with project teammate.
- The application is optimized with code-splitting techniques using React's `react-lazy` and `Suspense` for lazy loading, along with an `error boundary` fallback UI.
- Integrate `AWS s3` bucket for storing files.
- Eanched frontend performance by implementing `debouncing` and `throttling`.


## üìú Features

    - Filter tasks by task name, project name, or priority, and sort them.
    - Mark tasks as done or undo them
  

7. **File Module:**
    - Upload files to specific projects.
    - Allow project teammates to download and upload files.

9. **Chat Module:**
    - Communicate with teammates within specific projects.
    - Store chat history securely by encrypting it before storing it to database and decrypted it while retrieving past conversations.
    - Throttling the send button in a chat app prevents spam, reduces server load and ensures consistent performance

     ```
   - Start Docker
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```
     Note: After this you will get a ID copy that

     
   - Start Redis

    **For Windows Users:**
    
    Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to install Redis:
    
    1. Install WSL and a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) from the Microsoft Store.
    2. Open the WSL terminal and follow the Linux instructions to install Redis.

   

### 4. Running the Project

Start the frontend, backend, and Redis server:

6. Setup .env file 
    ```bash
    MONGO_URI = "Your Mongodb URI"
    PORT = "SERVER PORT NUMBER"
    JWT_SECRET = "Secret key"
    
    # AWS SERVICES ACCESS 
    ACCESS_KEY_ID = "AWS access key"
    SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "AWS secret access key for accesing"
    BUCKET_NAME = "S3 bucket name"
    REGION = "Region/country of your AWS account"
    
    # KEY FOR ENCRYPTION AND DESCRYPTION
    KeyCrypt = "Private key for encrypt and decryt"
    
    
    # MAILING
    EMAIL = "Email address to send mail"
    MAILPASS = "app-password for access to gmail services"

    # GOOGLE-AUTH
    SESSION_SECRET = "secret key for session"
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = "Client ID of Project create in Google console of your account"
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = "Secret key for accessing and verification"
    
    # FRONTEND
